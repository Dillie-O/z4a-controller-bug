#Z4A Controller Bug

This is a fresh build of Zurb Foundation for Apps using the CLI tool. After building, I create a new template page (news) and add a fresh controllers.js file so I can have a basic button click event.

Once built and run, you can navigate to the news page, but you will see an error about the controller file not being a function, or something weird like that.

Thanks Zurb for looking into this. You're amazing!!!
